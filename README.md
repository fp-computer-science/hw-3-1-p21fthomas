### Evaluating Expressions
---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw3-1-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Each solution should be stored as a variable so that it can be printed. Print each solution on its own line.
```
   solution1 = 2x
   print(solution1)
```
